# COTG-Attack-Drawings

Go to world map, then click incoming attack window to see incoming attacks, if you click on outgoing window you will see outgoing attacks.
Map refreshes regularly so its not permanent.
I drew lines on the world map HTML canvas from enemy cords to our cords, graphics limit too much zooming and clearity.
